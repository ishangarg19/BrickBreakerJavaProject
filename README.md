# BrickBreakerJavaProject
My ICS3U (Grade 11 computer studies) course final project, made in Java in NetBeans using the HSA console class. It is a bug-free Brick Breaker similar to the original Brick Breaker that has numerous levels and a top 10 high scores list that can be cleared by the user. Received 100% on the project.The HSA console class as a JAR file is added.
